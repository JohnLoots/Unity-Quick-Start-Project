Things i'd still like to add

Implement the mouse cursor and the product icon correctly.
Improve on the GUI a bit but it looks okay for now.
Refactor some parts of code like the preferences.
Setting the RendererData sorting stuff.
Events to automatically select cinemachine as a package when setup up a new camera.
Refining the post processing setup function.
Get it to somehow just center on startup.
Refactor the gui code somehow maybe through codeblocks.
